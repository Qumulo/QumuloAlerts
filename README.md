## Introduction

Collect Alarms from the hardware and Alerts from the software of one or more Qumulo clusters.

QumuloAlerts is an entire infrastructure, composed of multiple processes that provide the services.
At a minimum, there are always two processes. The first is "alerts"; which communicates with
one or more clusters. The information gathered is sent to the second process; called the "exchange".

Ultimately, the exhange will pass messages onto "subscriber" processes; which will filter, process, and output or store the messages.

Each of the components will be described in more detail below.

## Overview

Let's start with a picture of the the entire infrastructure.

## QumuloAlerts

QumuloAlerts, also called "alerts", is a docker container that collects alarms, alerts, and various other information from one or more Qumulo clusters and passes that information to an exchange (described below).

### Data Collected

All data is collected through individual plugins. There are three classifications of plugins; Alarms, Alerts, and Informational.

#### Alarms

Alarms are classified as hardware changes within a Qumulo cluster. The following list is just a sample of the Alarms collected. We may, in the future, collect more than listed below.

- Node Failure
- Disk Failure
- Power Supply Failure
- Fan Failure
- Network Interface Failure

#### Alerts

Alerts are classified as software or environmental changes within that same Qumulo cluster. The following list is just a sample of the Alerts collected. We may, in the future, add more alerts to those listed below.

- Quota Notification(s) - Done by configured percentage
- Snapshot Creation
- Snapshot Deletion
- Snapshot rate of change too high over a specified period of time (Used for RansomWare detection)
- Volume Notification - Done by configured percentage
- Replication Failure

#### Informational

Informational data is classified as any data on a Qumulo cluster that is not a hardware or software/environmental change.

Example data that is informational might be, but is not limited to:

- Throughput
- IOPS
- Latency
- Directory growth over a given period of time
- OS Version changes

## Exchange

The Exchange is a docker container that facilitates the handling of the messages generated by QumuloAlerts ("alerts"). The
reader should think of the exchange like you would an old fashioned telephone operator. In the past, before dial telephones, when somebody wanted to make a telephone call, you would tell the operator who you wanted to speak with. The operator would setup a connection between
the two parties; the caller and "the called". 

Our exchange is a process that takes messages from alerts and passes them to processes that will consume them. We haven't talked about
the consumers yet, but clearly there must be a method to notify any given group of users that something has happened on their cluster.
Those processes, described below, are broadly called consumers (because they consume the messages passed by the alerts process). 

## Consumers

A consumer process accepts a message from the Exchange and provides some further filtering and processing of that message. Once processed, the message is either stored, forwarded to another process for additional work, or sent directly to a user in the form of an email or SMS/Webhook message.
