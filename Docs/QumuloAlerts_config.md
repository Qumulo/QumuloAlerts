## Directory Structure

You should be in the ```config``` directory and looking at the following subdirectories:

```
drwxr-xr-x  12 someone  somegroup  384 Aug  4 13:09 consumer
drwxr-xr-x   7 someone  somegroup  224 Aug  4 13:09 alerts
```

Let's start by editing the files in the ```alerts``` subdirectory. 

```cd alerts```

You should see:

```
-rw-r--r--  1 someone  somegroup   638 Aug  2 13:23 QumuloAlerts.json
-rw-r--r--  1 someone  somegroup  2541 Aug  2 13:23 QumuloAlerts.schema.json
-rw-r--r--  1 someone  somegroup   204 Aug  4 13:09 QumuloExchange.json
-rw-r--r--  1 someone  somegroup   614 Aug  2 13:23 QumuloExchange.schema.json
drwxr-xr-x  4 someone  somegroup   128 Aug  3 17:06 plugins
```

### QumuloAlerts.json

Using your favorite editor, edit the file ```QumuloAlerts.json```. This file contains one or more json structures; one for each cluster that you wish to monitor. 

Let's look at the structure of one cluster.

```
[
    {
        "cluster_name": "cluster_1.qumulo.com",
        "cluster_port": 8000,
        "cluster_username": "USERNAME",
        "cluster_password": "PASSWORD",
        "nlb": false,
        "frequency": {
            "seconds": 30
        },
        "monitor": [
            {
                "category": "Alarms",
                "subcategory": ["Disk", "Node"],
                "enabled": true
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

There are three main sections within this configuration: The cluster, the frequency used to monitor the cluster, and what to monitor within the cluster.

1. Cluster Information
  
   - `cluster_name` - FQDN or IP address of the cluster to monitor.
   - `cluster_port` - The TCP port on which to access the cluster. The default is 8000.
   - `cluster_username` - Username needed to login to the cluster.
   - `cluster_password` - Password need to login to the cluster for the above username.
   - `nlb` - Boolean flag to define whether the **cluster_name** is an address to a network load balancer.  

Note: If you set **nlb** to false, then the cluster **must** be using floating IP's. This software will not work with persistent IP's as connections will be lost when a node is offline.

2. Frequency

   - `seconds` or `minutes` - How often should each plugin get information from the cluster

3. Monitor - This section must contain at least one entry and can contain many more

   - `category` - Either `Alarms`, `Alerts`, or `Informational`
   - `subcategory` - An array of plugins to run against the cluster
   - `enabled` - True or False. Should This monitor category and all of its subcategories be executed.
   - `frequency` [OPTIONAL] - A specific frequency of either seconds or minutes for this subcategory of plugins to run

Let's look at an specific configuration for a cluster and its plugins.

```
[
    {
        "cluster_name": "groot.xyzcorp.com",
        "cluster_port": 8000,
        "cluster_username": "admin",
        "cluster_password": "AdminisHere1!",
        "nlb": false,
        "frequency": {
            "minutes": 1
        },
        "monitor": [
            {
                "category": "Alarms",
                "subcategory": ["Disk, Nodes, PS, Fans, Network"],
                "enabled": true
            },
            {
                "category": "Alerts",
                "subcategory": ["Quotas"],
                "enabled": true
            },
            {
                "category": "Informational",
                "subcategory": ["OSUpgrade"],
                "enabled": true,
                "frequency":
                {
                    "minutes": 60
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Breaking down each of the three sections as follows:

1. Cluster Information
  
   - `cluster_name` - **groot.xyzcorp.com**
   - `cluster_port` - The default of **8000**
   - `cluster_username` - The default of **admin**
   - `cluster_password` - The password is **AdminisHere1!**
   - `nlb` - The cluster name of **groot.xyzcorp.com** does not use a network load balancer. This means that this cluster MUST use floating IP's.

Note: If you set **nlb** to false, then the cluster **must** be using floating IP's. This software will not work with persistent IP's as connections will be lost when a node is offline.

2. Frequency

   - `minutes` - Unless there is a specific frequency in the `Monitor` section, each plugin will get information from the cluster once per minute.

3. Monitor - This section contains three categories with subcategories. Let's explore each one:

  **Alarms Category**
  
   - `category` - `Alarms`
   - `subcategory` - An array of plugins `Disk`, `Node`, `PS`, `Fans`, and `Network`
   - `enabled` - `true`. Every plugin mentioned in the subcategory is enabled and will be executed once per minute.
  
  **Alerts Cateogry**
  
   - `category` - `Alerts`
   - `subcategory` - An array of plugins with one entry: `Quotas`
   - `enabled` - `true`. The quotas plugin mentioned in the subcategory is enabled and will be executed once per minute.

  **Informational Category**
  
   - `category` - `Informational`
   - `subcategory` - An array of plugins with one entry: `OSUpgrade`
   - `enabled` - `true`. The OSUpgrade plugin mentioned in the subcategory is enabled
   - `frequency` - Override the default frequency of 1 minute and instead use 60 minutes for this subcategory of plugins

Finally, let us look at a configuration file containing two clusters:

```
[
    {
        "cluster_name": "groot.xyzcorp.com",
        "cluster_port": 8000,
        "cluster_username": "admin",
        "cluster_password": "AdminisHere1!",
        "nlb": false,
        "frequency": {
            "minutes": 1
        },
        "monitor": [
            {
                "category": "Alarms",
                "subcategory": ["Disk, Nodes, PS, Fans, Network"],
                "enabled": true
            },
            {
                "category": "Alerts",
                "subcategory": ["Quotas"],
                "enabled": true
            },
            {
                "category": "Informational",
                "subcategory": ["OSUpgrade"],
                "enabled": true,
                "frequency":
                {
                    "minutes": 60
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "cluster_name": "baby-groot.xyzcorp.com",
        "cluster_port": 8000,
        "cluster_username": "admin",
        "cluster_password": "ThisisaSuperCluster!",
        "nlb": true,
        "frequency": {
            "seconds": 60
        },
        "monitor": [
            {
                "category": "Alarms",
                "subcategory": ["Nodes", "Disks"],
                "enabled": true
            },
            {
                "category": "Alerts",
                "subcategory": ["Quotas"],
                "enabled": true
            },
            {
                "category": "Informational",
                "subcategory": ["OSUpgrade"],
                "enabled": false,
                "frequency":
                {
                    "minutes": 60
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

The information for the first cluster in the above config file is the same as the previous example. Let us examine the second cluster `baby-groot.xyzcorp.com`. 

Notice that `nlb` is set to true. This means that there is a network load balancer and that it (the NLB) points to the cluster using the address `baby-groot.xyzcorp.com`.

All three categories will be monitored with `Alarms` only monitoring `Nodes` and `Disks`. `Alerts` will only be monitoring `Quotas` and `Informational` **would** be monitoring OSUpgrades, except that it is disabled.
